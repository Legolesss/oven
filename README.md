Design and Development of an Advanced and Energy-Efficient Electric Powder Coating Oven:

This project addresses a gap in the sheet metal fabrication and powder coating industry, where current industrial ovens are typically large, gas-powered, and lack any form of intelligent control. These ovens often operate on fixed timers with no feedback from the coated parts themselves, leading to significant energy wastage and inconsistent results.

Drawing on my background and hands-on experience in sheet metal fabrication, I propose to design and build a compact, electric powder coating oven tailored for small to medium-sized fabrication workshops and powder coating parts. The goal is to create a smart, energy-efficient system capable of delivering consistent coating results while significantly reducing operational energy costs.

Proposed Features and Technologies:

• Non-contact infrared thermometer to monitor real-time part temperature

• PID control algorithm implemented on a Raspberry Pi or microcontroller for precise thermal regulation

• Energy monitoring via current and voltage sensors to calculate real-time power consumption

• Touchscreen GUI interface for control input, temperature profiling, and energy data visualization

• Low-velocity recirculating fans to maintain uniform heat distribution without disturbing powder coating

• Insulated sliding door with full seal to minimize heat loss during operation

• Compact design: Approx. 1150 x 1150 x 2200 mm, sized to fit on a standard pallet for ease of transport and installation

Industry Relevance:

The final product will serve as a prototype for a scalable solution that smaller sheet metal and coating shops can adopt to alleviate bottlenecks in the current powder coating process. Additionally, it addresses growing industry interest in energy-efficient manufacturing practices.
